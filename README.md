A Deliverable is an assignment that is required to be submitted as instructed to your instructors.

Unless otherwise stated, no deliverable will be accepted past its due date, which is typically 1 week from when the deliverable was assigned.

Graduation requires that 80% of deliverables be completed (working) and delivered on time.



### Additional Coding Practice Resources

If/when you find yourself with extra time, and assuming you are caught up with your Daily JavaScript Code Challenges, look into these external resources:

#### codewars

[codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an excellent source of coding challenges for numerous programming languages.

It's free, so be sure to create an account so that you can track your progress.

Code challenges (called _Kata_) vary in difficulty from "8kyu" (easiest) to "1kyu".

#### Interview Cake

Designed to prep you technical interviews, [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) comes highly recommended.

It's not free, however, you should take advantage of its free 7-day email crash course and decide to if its worth the bucks to you.

### GA SEI Graduation Requirements

General Assembly's courses are pass/fail programs. We have certain requirements in order to be considered a graduate of the SEI program:
